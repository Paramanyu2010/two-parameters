Height is a key physical attribute often influenced by factors like sex. This analysis uses NHANES data collected in 2009 with 10,000 observations to estimate average recruit heights. A potential weakness is that our model assumes stability and representativeness, which may not hold if the population changes or data are biased.



$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon$$

with $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
